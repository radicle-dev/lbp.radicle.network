          <strong>The Radicle project will be distributing 3.75m Radicle tokens over 48 hours, from block x (~ 25.2.2021 4pm GMT) till block y  (~ 27.2.2021 4pm GMT). </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The event will take place on a decentralized exchange named Balancer, using a mechanism called Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool. Any proceeds generated from the event will end up in the Radicle Treasury, a smart contract fully controlled transparently by the Radicle token holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will tweet the contract address from our official Twitter account as well as update our blog. You can track the LBP event on <a href="lbp.radicle.network">lbp.radicle.network</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            Everything else should be considered a scam. Please make sure the Balancer address is the same as the contract address when proceeding.

        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <p><strong>Q1: What is the purpose of this event?</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          Radicle is progressively decentralizing its network by distributing decision-making power to a wider group of people.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The purpose of the proposed Liquidity Bootstrapping event is to:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Distribute the Radicle token among the wider Radicle community, beyond early contributors and team members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build deep liquidity for the Radicle network, setting it up for long-term success.
            </li>
            <li>
              Begin price discovery for the Radicle token.
              </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q2: What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool?</strong></p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/getting-started/faq">Balancer</a> is a decentralized exchange that allows anyone to swap one token for another. It’s built entirely on smart contracts, allowing transactions to take place securely and without the need for an intermediary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Balancer’s <a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)</a> is a Balancer pool that automatically adjusts its pool weights over time. This applies downward price pressure on the token and disincentivizes front-running, speculation and whale buying. See Balancer’s <a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool FAQ</a> for more information.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q3: Why did you pick the specific mechanism (LBP)?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The LBP has a number of properties that are desired for a liquidity bootstrapping event:
          <ol>
            <li>It prioritizes humans over bots</li>
            <li>It deals with front-running well</li>
            <li>It optimizes for smaller orders instead of “whale buying”</li>
            <li>The distribution is permissionless and scalable</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          This mechanism has also been battle tested by a number of teams like <a href="https://hydradx.substack.com/p/hydradx-faq">Hydra</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/apyfinance/apy-finance-tge-on-balancers-lbp-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-2690dd245a16">APY Finance</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/perpetual-protocol/why-we-chose-to-distribute-perp-using-a-balancer-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-aac7f1ab6181">Perpetual protocol</a>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q4: Where will the proceeds go?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The proceeds will go to the Radicle Treasury, a smart contract managed fully and transparently by the Radicle token holders. Read more about the Radicle Treasury and its governance <a href="https://radicle.blog/introducing-rad.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q5: What about members of the community that don’t have the funds or the technical expertise to participate in this event?</strong></p>
        <p>
          While this will be one way to become a member of the network, it won’t be the only way. The Radicle network aspires to be the first community owned and operated network for code collaboration. Understanding that not everyone has the capital or technical expertise to participate in this event, we plan on presenting proposals to the Treasury that address those concerns by allowing community members to “earn” tokens for their contributions to Radicle.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q6: How many Radicle tokens exist?</strong></p>
        <p>
          There are 100m Radicle tokens (fixed issuance).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q7: How many tokens are in circulation?</strong></p>
        <p>
          There are 9,909,526 Radicle tokens in circulation, including the tokens that will become available through the Liquidity Bootstrapping Event.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q8:  How was the initial price calculated?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The price was calculated based on the amounts of tokens in the Balancer pool and their weights
        </p>
        <p>
          3 750 000 RAD and 3 500 000 USDC in weights 92.5 : 7.5 = (3500000*92.5)/(3750000*7.5) = 11.5 USDC per RAD
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q9: How is the last price calculated?</strong></p>
        <p>
          This is hard to say as the price during the LBP depends on 1. The changing weights but also 2. Demand for buying. In the scenario that there is no demand at all the last price given will be:
        </p>
        <p>
          3 750 000 RAD and 3 500 000 USDC in weights 50 : 50 = (3500000*50)/(3750000*50) = 0.933 USDC per RAD
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q10: How are the price weights expected to change over time? Is there a price graph anywhere?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The price weights start at 92.5:7.5 and change linearly over time towards a 50%-50% split after 48 hours. See the graph below:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q11: What is the maximum and minimum amount of contribution?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The minimum is []
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no maximum as LBPs work differently than traditional exchanges.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q12: If there is no maximum, can someone buy all the tokens?</strong></p>
        <p>
          While this is theoretically feasible, in practice it will lead to a massive increase in price, because of slippage and the way AMMs work. So it’s practically very unlikely.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q13: Who founded the Radicle project?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Radicle project was founded by Alexis Sellier and Eleftherios Diakomichalis at the beginning of 2018.

        </p>
        <p>
          Eleftherios was previously the Vice President for Data Science and Engineering at Soundcloud.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Q14: Who are the existing supporters?</strong></p>

        <p>With those in mind, let’s examine why we end up going with LBP:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>🤖 Bots have no advantage to humans</dt>
          <dd>
            Since the price of the asset inside an LBP will start from high and gradually go down with the passage of time, if a bot immediately gets PERP when the pool is live, the price on Balancer will soon be lower than the acquisition price that the bot has paid after the weight change.
          </dd>
          <dt>📅 LBP lasts for a couple of days (can result in better price discovery)</dt>
          <dd>
            The LBP in our case will last for three days, meaning that no matter which timezone you’re in, you’ll have your chance to get the tokens. And people aren’t incentivized to FOMO in at the start, which should result in better price discovery.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          TLDR: LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool) is an adjustable Balancer smart contract that is used for initial distribution and price discovery of new assets. It uses a constant selling pressure and has a limited time duration, during which price continually drops if there is no demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are a total noob we do not think it is a good idea for you to participate anyways. To learn more about what LBP is, we recommend this <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution-a49d4286e0d4">introduction from Balancer.</a>

          <strong>DISCLAIMER: The text below is just a description of how the LBP Price discovery works in theory. Any figures mentioned serve only as an illustration. Engaging in LBP without necessary skills or experience can result in a loss of funds. This is a very experimental tool so please treat it as such.</strong>

        <p>
          Since AMMs became a thing, Uniswap listing has become a distribution mechanism of choice. However, the underlying parameters of a Uniswap pool are making this very capital intensive (due to slippage prevention) and also do not guarantee a wide and meaningful distribution.
